Hi, my name is Anthony (@axb21). I am a computer scientist with a long-running interest in complex dynamical systems and specifically the consequences of interactions that can occur within them. My Ph.D. was on coevolutionary algorithms, a type of evolutionary algorithm in which the fitness of an individual is determined from the outcomes of its interactions with other individuals. In my current role I am working on a large-scale multi-sector infrastructure simulation, with a special focus on cascading failures that can occur as a consequence of the interdependencies among sectors.
